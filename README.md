# nn-rs (neural network)

A project for exploring perceptron neural network in Rust

### What is This Exactly?

The network aims to identify 'handwritten' digits from ```0-9``` (hopefully accurately) using the MNIST dataset

### Goals

- [x] get matrix library up and running
- [x] MNIST data loader
- [x] get basic network structure
- [x] drawing app
- [x] model serialization with Serde
- [x] momentum optimizer
- [ ] improve model accuracy / generalization
- [ ] multithreaded data training
- [ ] create generic Data trait for feeding network data

### Note

This project is meant as a hobby. All the logic is implemented from scratch.
